At Digital Grassroots, we are passionate about the core values of the Internet and we strive towards ensuring openness, security, privacy, Web literacy and decentralization of the internet.
We have a goal of increasing digital literacy amongst the young population (14 - 29 years) globally in order to promote their activity as stakeholders in the Internet ecosystem at the most basic levels.

### **The Problem**

Despite being major stakeholders of the internet, youths and marginalized communities are underrepresented in major policy developments and implementation processes that affect the future of the internet.
There is an existing lack of awareness of basic internet literacy knowledge in local grassroot communities.

### **The Solution**

1. Through our Digital Grassroots ambassadors program:
-  We engage our Digital Grassroots Ambassadors (young people around the world aged 14 - 29) on a 4 week online Internet Literacy Course and a 4 week mentorship, giving them an opportunity to kickstart active involvement and careers in internet governance. 
-  We also guide ambassadors through a weekly community engagement process where they share their knowledge from the internet literacy course with their local communities.
-  We organize Internet Governance events where we provide a platform for our ambassadors as well as other youth to discuss Internet Governance policy issues as they relate to the to their communities.


 2. Digital Grassroots is divided into 8 principal departments:- Ambassadors, Advocacy, Community Events, Partnerships, Memberships, Research, Products & Services, Affiliate programs.
Through our departments we:-
- Engage in Internet Activism (IA) in order to create a safe Internet.
- Create a Digital Natives Network (DNN) among youth


### **Who Are We?**

We are a diverse team of youth leaders from 10 countries and 3 continents who are passionate about addressing various Internet Governance Issues on a global scale.
