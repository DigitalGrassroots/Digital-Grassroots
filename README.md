# Digital-Grassroots
What are we doing?

The problem
Despite being major stakeholders of the internet, youths and marginalized communities are underrepresented in major policy developments and implementation processes that affect the future of the internet.
There is an existing lack of awareness of basic internet literacy knowledge in local grassroot communities.

The solution 
Through our Digital Grassroots ambassadors program:
 We engage our Digital Grassroots Ambassadors (young people around the world aged 14 - 29) on a 4 weeks Internet Literacy Course and mentorship, giving them an opportunity to kickstart active involvement and careers in internet governance. 
We also guide ambassadors through a weekly community engagement process where they share their knowledge from the internet literacy course with their local communities. 

At Digital Grassroots, we are passionate about the core values of the Internet and we strive towards ensuring openness, security, privacy, Web literacy and decentralization of the internet.


Who are we?
The founders of Digital Grassroots are a group of Fellows from Internet Society (ISOC) 2017 Youth@IGF Program. We are youth leaders from around the world who are passionate about addressing various internet governance issues. The digital Grassroots initiative started as a result of a need we observed during our participation at the 12th Internet Governance Forum as it was evident that there was low representation of youths and grassroots communities in internet policy discussions and decisions, hence, Digital Grassroots started to take action in tackling these issues and we had our first official meeting at the United Nations in Geneva. There is more information about the team here. 


What do we need?
In order to achieve our goal of increasing digital literacy amongst the young population globally in order to promote their activity as stakeholder in the Internet ecosystem at the most basic levels, we require collaboration with experts in various fields (content development, design, marketing, finance, language translation etc) to enable us expand our reach and engage an extremely diverse group of young people. Endorsement from key industry stakeholders will also go a long way to enforce the credibility of our organisation and activities. We are always looking for new ways to improve on our methods of operation and be more impactful to our Digital Grassroots Ambassadors. 

Get involved 
Digital Grassroots runs an open program and we are always looking out for ways to partner and collaborate with related organisations and individuals around the world in order to achieve our goals.
